## What is Pub Analyzer for?

Pub Analyzer is a tool designed to retrieve, process and present in a concise and understandable way the scientific production of a researcher, including detailed information about their articles, citations, collaborations and other relevant metrics. The tool automates the collection and processing of data, providing users with a comprehensive view of the impact of their research and contributions in academia.

All our information comes from OpenAlex, an open and complete catalog of the world's scholarly papers, researchers, journals, and institutions &mdash; along with all the ways they're connected to one another[^1]. This is the key piece to **make all this possible**.

Pub Analyzer generates reports that you can view directly within the app, [export as PDF]() files to submit as evidence, or [export as JSON]() for analysis with the tools you use every day.

## Why use Pub Analyzer?

Researchers are generally required to submit scientific production reports when seeking promotions or funding to support their ongoing research. Instead of laborious manual tracking of their publications and citations, researchers now have the opportunity to perform all of these tasks automatically **in a matter of minutes**.

!!! tip "Automation"
    We know that your time is important, which is why one of our main goals is to reduce as much as possible the time you spend making reports for bureaucratic reasons. We've got you covered. :winking_face:

## Benefits for Researchers

- **Make citation Analysis** &mdash; Track the citations your research work has received, allowing you to understand the influence of your work within academia.
- **Classify the Citations type** &mdash;  Classifies citations as type A or type B, relevant information required for some reports. [Learn more]().
- **Open Access** &mdash; The tool collects the type of licensing under which research papers were published, which helps you understand how your research is shared and accessed.
- **Summaries and Trends** &mdash; Pub Analyzer generates summaries of articles and citations by year, allowing researchers to identify growth patterns and areas of greatest impact.
- **Collaborations** &mdash; The tool shows who the researcher has collaborated with on their projects, fostering an understanding of collaboration networks and areas of common interest.

## Benefits for Institutions

- **Full Reports** &mdash; Institutions can generate detailed reports on the scientific production of all affiliated researchers, which provides a panoramic view of research activity within the institution.
- **Collaboration Analysis** &mdash; Institutions can identify trends in collaboration between their researchers and other institutions, which can facilitate the planning of strategic collaborations.
- **Impact Assessment** &mdash; The tool allows institutions to assess the impact of their researchers on the scientific community, which can be useful for demonstrating research excellence and attracting funding.
- **Visibility** &mdash; By providing a detailed view of the scientific production of the institution, Pub Analyzer can increase the visibility and reputation of the institution in the academic field.
- **Decision Support** &mdash; The reports generated by the tool can serve as the basis for strategic decision-making in relation to research and institutional collaborations.
