## Projects we use

Pub Analyzer is the result of the work of many people, not just the author and the contributors of the project. Behind there is a lot of effort from big projects that make all this possible. That is why we want to recognize them in this section and we also invite you to support them.

### <a href="https://openalex.org/" target="_blank">OpenAlex</a>

The collection and the accuracy of the information are fundamental characteristics for Pub Analyzer. This is possible thanks to OpenAlex, which is our main source of information and which provides a well-documented API that we use in our application.

From Pub Analyzer we are eternally grateful to [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/){target=_blank} for their great work with OpenAlex. If this project has benefited you, it is largely thanks to them, so we ask you to consider writing a [testimonial](https://forms.monday.com/forms/4d5ad5a8e6a72ae31987a29118f1d437){target=_blank} and thanking them on our behalf.

### <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" target="_blank">Pydantic</a>

Pydantic is the fundamental piece to manage all the data we receive from OpenAlex. It allows us to validate large amounts of information and export it in JSON format.This library has become essential in practically any python project that requires validating data.


### <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/" target="_blank">Textual</a>

If you had wondered how Pub Analyzer displayed such complex graphical interfaces in the Terminal, well this is thanks to Textual. The terminal is an environment that was clearly not intended to deploy this type of project, but the folks at [Textualize](https://www.textualize.io/) have made this possible.


### <a href="https://typst.app/" target="_blank">Typst</a>

Exporting PDF reports is probably one of the features I'm most proud of in Pub Analyzer. Typically, this feature is implemented in other applications that use external dependencies installed on the system. But since Pub Analyzer aims to be a cross-platform project, being able to include the engine responsible for generating PDF files within the package, without compromising the size of the final package, is simply a miracle.

At the end of the day, Typst offers more value than simply generating a PDF: it gives us the opportunity for our users to customize their reports using the information we provide them.
